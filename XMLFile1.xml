    <title>Discovery: Annette Karmiloff-Smith</title>
    <description>In Discovery this week psychologist Professor Annette Karmiloff-Smith talks to Jim Al-Khalili about her Life Scientific. For over forty years she’s been researching brain development and how babies and children learn. She’ll be talking about her controversial response to guidance from the American Academy of Paediatrics, that parents should discourage TV viewing in children under 2. She says that if the subject matter is chosen well, a TV screen can be better for a baby than a book.</description>

Over the coming years, Curiosity will climb a mountain at the crater’s heart, gathering evidence on one of science’s greatest questions – was there ever life on Mars?   The $2.5 billion project will discover whether Mars once had conditions suitable for the evolution and survival of life.
